My take on the brief is -Taking the structured practice of programmimg through a unstructuring process of deconstruction. 
What do WE want from our algorithms? We use it as a tool to make sense of the world around us by putting nature into step by step logic, we use it to write a set of instructions which is objective enough to be understood and worked upon universally, and over years it has also evolved into a language representing culture and human understanding. Unlike cultural languages evolved over centuries within smaller and larger sects, where a sentence, a word or even a sound can have different meanings, a programming language is comparitively objective. Although, it is understood that words have a meaning only when placed in a cultural context. With algorithmic language, logic drives the language as a universal medium such that there is lesser diversity in its understanding. My take on this project is to understand how we influence algorithms and how algorithms influence us. And, to find out how algorithms shape our culture, desicions and behaviours and at the same time how we are shaping it. Although the focus driven by my understanding as of now, is towards the implications of algorithms, but algorithms as a language in making meaning, conversations and sense, explored through the course will help expand this focus. 
As mentioned in the breif, the semantics, syntax the language structure builds an understanding of the intended information. Hence, while democritising algorithms, the algorithmic language as well could evolve into a language reflecting its meaning and making sense of information it holds. What are these gaps and overlaps, in the cultural and logical traits, of a language. Especially, I want to understand how their syntax differs and changes, while moving from high level to low level language.

If algorithms are the language for a shared understanding of logic, in how many different ways are we still deciphering it. It has built a base for atomation. A tool for human ease and reducing human error. But in this process it also machanizes human responses and constraints meaning making by provinding a single right output. Hence, what would be subjectivity mean for automation?

Week 1: | Class Introduction | Algorithms around Us | "What Algorithms Want?" chapter 1 | Oribaka

Algorithms are a set of instructions, each dicrete in nature, which on repeated n number of times takes us closer to the intended solution. Alogorithms can also be seen as evident patterns. Algorithms can be a logocal representation of the uviverse. Or an abstraction betwwen a problem and a solution. For examplem the way we count cash- highest domination to the lowest domination, traffic signals, or even blockchain management. Algorithms interpretted from cultural surroundings have cultural traces instilled in them. Hence, algorithms built within one culture is problamatic in a place of a different culture. Universally accepted language of algorithms have different structural formations based on the writer/programmer.

What algorithms want-
Algorithic language starting from binary code, build pathways in the brain to make new connections. This language develops funtionality untill the software becomes a part of the hardware. Language and meaning in a different context could also appear as codes and magic. Until the language develops a meaning, it is a code and, untill the meaning has a language, it is magic. Myth as well is sold as magic. Where, these procedural atturances are meanings trying to be developed by human curiosity and imagination than nature and language. Words are codes that change identity. Words exist but the meaning is shaped when placed in a cultural context, becomimg liguistic machines. Humanity has understood that collectively we can also make the world not just describe it using language. These meanings, structured and abstracted using curiosity and intuition, to call it something leads us to making language and also developing the skill of making languages. We have critical laguages- news, abstract languages- emoji, computer languages, fiction. These give magical powers to symbols and meaning to apply itself differently in different contexts. The algorithimic language is a development bridging gaps between 'reality and representation' making a 'computational shadow' of the reality. Such as the golden ratio, a biological expressions of mathematical figures. Logical order, grammer and symbolic vocabulary underlies in the understanding of the universe. Hence, computation is also the cultural shadow of the reality made with long formation of logical thinking. Myth and reason is what we can know and think repectively. Language defines the world or enactes the world in our minds and algorithms compile assembleges of abstractions, processes and people to enact theoritical ideas in pragmatic instructions. The gap between the two is the implimentation.

Oribaka- The crease of the paper.
The challenge was to create a sound only language for origami instructions. Similar to any language, the learning of origami in oribaka is still multimodal, representative and instructed. But further on instructions are delivered only through sound. 
Origami is a game of mind and body coordination. Taking the visual away, any distraction in the body or the mind, could and does confuse the user. Thus visual instructions help the user to follow but do not leave the brain capacity between orientation, seeing and applying to actually learn. The instruction set makes people constantly navigate between paper and instruction book. A voice only limited sound language puts more focus into making. And the simplyfying of the language by using reproduction of signs and symbols exhibitting similarity and reletavity as we tried to apply in oribaka, helps learning. Hence, the languge we built is intended to be fun and recitable.  Although, a language for origami should be one which is reproductive but also explorative and customizable which we ended up cutting down in our model. Orgami as a practice is the art of making through learing and exploration.

Week 2: | Structuring the language | Testing the Language | Insights | "What Algorithms Want?" chapter 2 

Oribaka Cntd.-
One is to desgn restricted to a context and one is to design that fits every context. Designing the language of oribaka, we arrived at a similar descision to be made. On having decided on the sounds and labels of the folds, we had to expand the language to account for complexity as the user progresses in the level of difficulty in origami. The syntax was decided to have punctuation marks as halts to represent a simgle word (instruction) within the sentence (an entire origami piece). The difficulty here rose as each word become larger with complexity to be pronouced and recited altogether. We tried exhibiting the same instruction in different ways. Hence an algorithm can have various ways of instructing a function. But it was realized that some are more usable/user friendly than the others. 

On testing the language, it was understood that what makes people learn origami is origami itself. Hidden pattern of folding a small sheet of pape was revealed because of this language. The learning section was straightforward with no mixing ups and overload. It was also important to structure the learning that way. Folds, Actions and Positions. The most dangerous element was orientation. It was realized the quicker the instructions and given, less time there is to change the orientation, even if by mistake. But for that, the language must be memorised. On testing amoungst ourself it did succeed as we had inevitable learnt that language asfer spending two whole days on it. But to the first time users, we provided an instruction set it refer. This again brings back the problem of diverted attention betwwen the origami paper and instruction set causing changes in orientation. The insight here was also that we didnt have means for error prevention and course correction. While programming these can just be added further as functions keeping check or as extentions in the program to alert if such cases arrive. But, to apply these in a simple language, requires restructuring of the language itself.  


What Algorithms Want?-
Snowcrash is a game where a sumerian is on an excavation misssion. The Excavated stones have magical signs a nd symbols. Although a Sumerian myth, it is very easy to identify the paralles between the magical stones and functioning algorith,s. Excavating logic from the deepest parts of the brain, to find a set of operating instructions which when together make something happen. The game is a virtual aspect of reality, its code and its metaphor is reality. A hacker, an excavator in a cultural context is seen as one who performs intervensions with technological skill, idealistic thinking and culture disobeyance. Deciphering reality away from its cultural meanings into a logical strcuture only decipherable by other hackers all creating intervention in the world. The word hacker has come to become a metaphor for the people implicated to be hackers. Is it a source code or sorcery? One always questions if the code is benefitting or is a witchcraft on the soceity making things happen away from the common agrements of the soceity. Computation is suseptable to be labled as mystical where the medium through which the plot propogates is the mystical part. But on the other hand a hacker is mainly interpretting the reality through computation, source code, procedural languages, hacks and trics. Lately, computation is more thinkable and tangible than distant. With cell phones in everyone's hands, for example, the 90% cell phone penetration in india with the digital india movement, computation has renamed it self to be a tool for mass communication, a social good tool and a means to being heard. Infact, a lot of us have become intimate with with this computation. Trusting it to make us meet our partners, a channel for confidential communication, banking, etc. The faith that computation holds is seen godly. But how do we keep a check on it, question it, when we are scred of it? This it is important to live with machines without worshiping them. It is merely a procedural language that exsts between the mind and in the world. Such that, we now can interact with the world amd our environment. Language is an intelectual technology. But to take control it is important for every one define it. If no word for green, how do we perceive green? it is difficult to articulate an idea somethimes. And amidst not democritising this language, we are losing out on a lasrge amount of intelectual technology and instead biasing interpration. The power of language is to structure and prioritise experience. Codes are also bodies of knowlegde. They are technical entities indipendent of their own human practitioners, but oppererating through the medium of culture being a vehicle or a tool of algorithms. The role of humanity is the methodology of critical thinking and algorithmic thinking which is required to understand the complexity of the intersection between computation and culture, the world and the human. Thus, algorithms stitch theories from all- mythical, compulational and cultural spaces. Personifying code as a cathedral is a definition in similar terms. A Cathedral is a physical and spiritual structure. It also represents invisiblity of access to religion as is to code. A cathedral is a space for collective belief, a structure that embodies a framework of understanding about the world- visible and invisible. At the same time, we downsize effort and work as efficiency due to these algorithms. All the while forgetting the effort and work put by humans for and against it. As David Berlinsky says, "we have replaced a cathedral that already existed. We wanted a universal language for exchange of knowledge but what we have now is another cathedral claiming to do all the rational work on our behalf". Bringing us back to the faith we are putting into these algorithms. How do we thus create algorithms for humans and their culture?


--- Notes to Myself ---

cathedral of computation. by Ian Bougust.
computational culture- metaphors- code as structure. ex-architecture, portals, etc. depersonify software, rejecting agency in software like buildings where only engineers and users can enter. cathedral as a metaphor for code. turing's cathedral, cathedral and the bazar. raymond suggesting open bazar model instead of the top down approach of the cathedral. "softwares and cathedrals are the same. first we build them and then we pray." belief rather than bits. cathedral is a physical and spiritual structure.it also represents invisiblity of access to religion as is to code. A cathedral is a space for collective belief, a structure that embodies a framework of understanding about the world- visible and invisible. we have developed a relationship of faith with algorithms that help us through our day to day lives. We downsize effort and work as efficiency of the algorithms all the while forgetting the effort and work put by humans for and against it. we have replaced a cathedral that already existed. we wanted a universal language for exchange of knowledge but what we have now is another cathedral claiming to do all the rational work on our behalf. david berlinsky- universal computation and universal design. 
information and meaning- like turing machine, what the machine does and what imoact it has on human mind. facebook's mission ststement is to give people the power to make the world more open and connected. propriotary commerce claming to make the world transparent. bougust claimimg computation and new theology.

## Personal Bio

I am a Human-Centered Design student, majoring in User Experience Design from Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology.

Finding inspiration from my everyday explorations, I direct my passionate, imaginative and critical mind towards work that ensures delight and makes a change. I back my design approach with user studies, technology, business understanding and problem-solving. I harness the systems identified and set-up by our societies to work with the interdependent liability and assets to turn the tables to a usable and effective result.

My work shows diversified skills and knowledge in the UX process, various UX and interaction design methods, inclusive design, emotional design and Design Research. With my skills in visual communication and information visualization for print and for the web, I have built campaigns, prototypes, and digital user interfaces. I delve into algorithmic problem solving and zooming into micro-interactions when dealing with the complex as well as behavior dependent systems.

I use my developing, programming and prototyping skills in HTML, CSS, javascript, C++, Python, etc. to have a better understanding of my design, test them and further be able to execute them when needed. I use Adobe Illustrator, Indesign, Dreamweaver, XD, sketch, etc. to as tools to supplement my process.

Sustainability, Navigation, Road Traffic Flow, National Development, Emotional Design,
Micro-Interactions, Algorithmic Thinking and Programming, Women’s Rights and Children’s Welfare are some of the topics that keep me motivated.
