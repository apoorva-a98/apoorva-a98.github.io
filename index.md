Taking the structured practice of programmimg through a unstructing process of deconstruction. What do we want from our algorithms? It sometimes making sense of the world around us by putting it into step by step logic. It is to a write a set of instructions objective enough to be understood and work universally. Over years it has evolved into a language representing culture and human understanding. My take on this project is to understand how we influence algorithms and how algorithms influence us. To find out how algorithms shape culture, desicions and behaviour and how we are shaping it.what
If algorithms is the language of shared understanding of logic, in how many different ways are we deciphering it. It has built a base for atomation. A tool for human ease and reducing human error.
