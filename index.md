Taking the structured practice of programmimg through a unstructuring process of deconstruction. What do we want from our algorithms? We use it as a tool to make sense of the world around us by putting nature into step by step logic. We alsp use it to write a set of instructions which are objective enough to be understood and worked upon universally. Over years it has evolved into a language representing culture and human understanding. Unlike cultural languages evolved over centuries within sects and larger sects, a sentence, a word or even a sound can have different meanings. Words have a meaning only when placed in a cultural context. With algorithmic language, logic drives the language as a universal medium with less diverse understanding. My take on this project is to understand how we influence algorithms and how algorithms influence us. To find out how algorithms shape culture, desicions and behaviour and how we are shaping it. Although the focus driven by my understanding as of now, is towards the implications of algorithms, but algorithms as a language in making meaning, conversations and sense explored through the course will expand the focus. On doing so, as mentioned in the breif, the semantics, syntax the language structure builds an understanding of the intended information. Hence, the democritise algorithms, algorithm language needs to develop on this method of making sense of information. hence, what are the gaps and overlaps in the cultural and logical traits of a language and especially i want to understand how their syntax differs, while moving from high language to low language.

If algorithms is the language of shared understanding of logic, in how many different ways are we deciphering it. It has built a base for atomation. A tool for human ease and reducing human error. But in this process machanizing human responses is a resukt of objectivity. Hence, what would be subjectivity for automation?

 Week 1: Class Introduction | Algorithms around Us | "What Algorithms Want?" chapter 1 | Oribaka

Algorithms are a set of instructions, each dicrete in nature, which on repeated n number of times takes us closer to the intended solution. Alogorithms can also be seen as evident patterns. For examplem the way we count cash- highest domination to the lowest domination, traffic signals, or even blockchain management. Algorithms interpretted from cultural surroundings have cultural traces instilled in them. Hence, algorithms built within one culture is problamatic in a place of a different culture. Universally accepted language of algorithms have different structural formations based on the writer/programmer.

What algorithms want-
Algorithic language startoing from binary code, build pathways in the brain to make new connections. This language develops funtionality untill the software becomes a part of the hardware. Language and meaning in a different context could also appear as codes and magic. Until the language develops a meaning, it is a code and untill the meaning has a language, it is magic. Myth as well is sold as magic. Where, these procedural atturances are meanings trying to be developed by human curiosity and imagination than nature and languae. Words are codes that change identity. Words exist but the meaning is shaped when placed in a cultural context, becomimg liguistic machines. Humanity has understood that collectively we can also make the world not just describe it using language. Thses meanings, structured and abstracted using curiosity and intuition, to call it something and make meaning. We have also developed the skill of making languages. We have critical laguages- news, abstract languages- emoji, computer languages, fiction. These give magical powers to symbols and meaning. Algorithimic language, is developed between 'reality and representation' making a  'computational shadow'. Such as the golden ratio, a biological expressions of mathematical figures. Logical order, grammer and symbolic vocabulary underlies in the understanding of the universe. Hence, computation is the cultural shadow of reality made with long formation of logical thinking. Myth and reason- what we can know and think. Language defines the world or enactes the world in our minds. Algorithms compile assembleges of abstractions, processes and people to enact theoritical ideas in pragmatic instructions. The gap between the two is the implimentation.

Oribaka- The crease of the paper
The challenge was to create a sound only language for origami instructions. Similar to any language, the learning is still multimodal and instructed. Origami is a game of mind and body coordination. The instruction set takes people off following instructions to copying them which constantly navigation between paper and instruction book. A voice only limited sound language puts more focus into making. Although, a language for origami should be one which is explorative, customizable and reproductive. Hence, the languge we build was intended to fun and recitable.

Excavation. Snowcrash. Sumerian myth- digging up to find symbols and language that is magical. melglomaniacal millionare found minded sumerian stones with signs and symbols. virtual reality and ubiquitoes computing- set of operating instruction that when figures out with logic can actually make something happen- just like magic. hackers. hacker figure- intervensions with tech skill, idealistic thinking and away from culture. hackers and people implicated- methaphors. Source code or soucery. compution is suseptable to mystical. medium through which the plot propogates is the mystical part. but the hacker is what the insripation comes from- computation, source code, procedural languages, hacks and trics. but it is not so distant anymore but thinkable and tangible. we are not just close but we are intimate. we are all sharing personal experiences to it, buying properties, etc. code- a procedural language that exsts in the mind and in the world. lang is a intelectual technology. code- lang can reformate the world and the mind. language- huaman understanding dissected into the language given to colour. it is difficult to articulate idea somethimes. if no word for green, how do we perceive green? source code or susaury? The power of language to structure and prioritise experience. Some incantations cannot be ignored. they affect and change us as soon as we are facing it. intersection of reality- code can be magical. unrsal operating system. code can change the world. codes are also bodoies of knowlegde. there are technical entities indipendent of their own human practitioners, but they oppererate through the medium of culture. - Algorithms. vehicle or tool of algorithms. role of humanity is the methodology of critical thinking and algorithmic thinking which is required to understand the complexity of the intersection between computation and culture. algorithms stitch theories from mythical, compulational and cultural spaces. 

cathedral of computation. by Ian Bougust.
computational culture- metaphors- code as structure. ex-architecture, portals, etc. depersonify software, rejecting agency in software like buildings where only engineers and users can enter. cathedral as a metaphor for code. turing's cathedral, cathedral and the bazar. raymond suggesting open bazar model instead of the top down approach of the cathedral. "softwares and cathedrals are the same. first we build them and then we pray." belief rather than bits. cathedral is a physical and spiritual structure.it also represents invisiblity of access to religion as is to code. A cathedral is a space for collective belief, a structure that embodies a framework of understanding about the world- visible and invisible. we have developed a relationship of faith with algorithms that help us through our day to day lives. We downsize effort and work as efficiency of the algorithms all the while forgetting the effort and work put by humans for and against it. we have replaced a cathedral that already existed. we wanted a universal language for exchange of knowledge but what we have now is another cathedral claiming to do all the rational work on our behalf. david berlinsky- universal computation and universal design. 
information and meaning- like turing machine, what the machine does and what imoact it has on human mind. facebook's mission ststement is to give people the power to make the world more open and connected. propriotary commerce claming to make the world transparent. bougust claimimg computation and new theology.
